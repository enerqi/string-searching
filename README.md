# String-Searching

Playing with string searching algorithms and generative testing in python3.

## Dev/Test Setup

- Use conda or virtualenv to create an isolated python environment.
- Install the dependencies in `requirements-dev.txt` or `requirements-test.txt`.
  Requirements not available in the anaconda repositories must be `pip` installed.

## Run Tests

`pytest`

## Run Lint

`flake8 .`


## Build Package

The usual `python setup.py` - but not currently configured properly to run tests etc as a precursor.
